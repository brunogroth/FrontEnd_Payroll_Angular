# FRONTFolhas

Front End App for <a href="https://github.com/brunogroth/WebAPIPayrollCSharp">Payroll</a> project made at college.

This Angular application makes requests in ASP.NET Core WebAPI. 

## Enviroment Configuration

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Please clone also the <a href="https://github.com/brunogroth/WebAPIPayrollCSharp"> Backend </a> repository and run it in parallel, so the HTTP Request's can be received and handled correctly.
The ASP.NET Core API already has all the necessary CORS policies to receive, proccess and return the HTTP Requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
